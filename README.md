# EclipseCon2023-Tutorial
Materials for the Langium Tutorial (proposed) at EclipseCon 2023

This repository will contain the running code example for the proposed tutorial "Create Domain-Specific Languages with Langium" with branches for the different tasks of the tutorial. We are going to prepare a Gitpod workspace configuration for a quick start.

Auxiliary materials (for example a PDF with the task descriptions) will be placed in this repository as well.

We hope you are going to have fun with it!
